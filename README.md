# Shadow Mansion
A game created for a private Game Jam. Theme was "shadow catcher".

---

The game became a lot smaller than I anticipated and is really just a tech demo of what was planned with three rooms one type of basic enemy and one boss enemy.

## Steering
Steering works with `W`, `A` and `S` for jumping and walking. Aim with your mouse and club with the left mouse button.
In boss fights a shadow power bar will fill up. When it's filled your wand will glow and you can consume the shadows by pressing the right mouse button.
You can pick up lanterns when in range with `E`.

## Health
The character has basically only one life but can protect itself from the shadows by smashing lanterns it carries in emergency situations.

## Last words
That's already it. It was a fun experiment to create something with Godot and GDScript but I don't whink I'll ever continue this project.
